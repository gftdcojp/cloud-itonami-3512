  "The governor contract as executable tests -- the community-energy-
  operator analog of `cloud-itonami-isic-6512`'s `casualty.governor-
  contract-test`. The single invariant under test:

    Energy Advisor never dispatches a battery action or finalizes a
    settlement the Grid Policy Governor would reject, `:actuation/
    dispatch-battery`/`:actuation/finalize-settlement` NEVER auto-
    commit at any phase, `:site/intake` (no direct capital risk) MAY
    auto-commit when clean, and every decision (commit OR hold) leaves
