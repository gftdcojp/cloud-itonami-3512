  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the community-energy-operator analog
  of `cloud-itonami-isic-6512`'s `casualty.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- site intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds tariff verification + grid-
                                 instability screening writes, still
                                 approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:site/intake` (no capital risk yet)
                                 may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 dispatch-battery`/`:actuation/
                                 finalize-settlement` NEVER auto-
                                 commit, at any phase.

  `:actuation/dispatch-battery`/`:actuation/finalize-settlement` are
  deliberately ABSENT from every phase's `:auto` set, including phase
  3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to
  come. Dispatching a real battery charge/discharge or switching
  action and finalizing a real tariff/settlement report are the two
  real-world acts this actor performs; both are always a human
  operator's call. `energy.governor`'s `:actuation/dispatch-battery`/
  `:actuation/finalize-settlement` high-stakes gate enforces the same
  invariant independently -- two layers, not one, agree on this.
  `:demand/screen` is likewise never auto-eligible, at any phase --
  the same posture every sibling's screening op has. Phase 3's `:auto`
  set here has only ONE member (`:site/intake`) -- this domain has no
  separate no-capital-risk 'file' lifecycle distinct from the site
  record itself.")
