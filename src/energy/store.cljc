  "SSoT for the energy actor, behind a `Store` protocol so the backend
  is a swap, not a rewrite -- the same seam every prior `cloud-
  itonami-isic-*` actor in this fleet uses:

    - `MemStore`     -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for
                        dev/tests/demo (no deps).
    - `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible
                        EAV store (datalog q / pull / upsert). Pure `.cljc`,
                        so it runs offline AND can be pointed at a real
                        Datomic Local or a kotoba-server pod by swapping
                        `langchain.db`'s `:db-api` (see langchain.kotoba-db).

  Both implement the same protocol and pass the same contract
  (test/energy/store_contract_test.clj), which is the whole point: the
  actor, the Grid Policy Governor and the audit ledger never know
  which SSoT they run on.

  Like every prior dual-actuation sibling, this actor has TWO
  actuation events (dispatching a battery action, finalizing a
  settlement) acting on the SAME entity (a site), each with its OWN
  history collection, sequence counter and dedicated double-
  actuation-guard boolean (`:battery-dispatched?`/`:settlement-
  finalized?`, never a `:status` value) -- the same discipline every
  prior sibling governor's guards establish, informed by `cloud-
  itonami-isic-6492`'s status-lifecycle bug (ADR-2607071320).

  The ledger stays append-only on every backend: 'which site was
  screened for an unresolved grid-instability flag, which battery
  action was dispatched, which settlement was finalized, on what
  jurisdictional basis, approved by whom' is always a query over an
  immutable log -- the audit trail a community trusting an energy
  operator needs, and the evidence an operator needs if a dispatch or
  settlement decision is later disputed."
