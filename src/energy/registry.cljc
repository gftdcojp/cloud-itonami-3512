  "Pure-function battery-dispatch + settlement-finalization record
  construction -- an append-only community-energy-operator book-of-
  record draft.

  Like every sibling actor's registry, there is no single
  international check-digit standard for a battery-dispatch or
  settlement reference number -- every operator/jurisdiction assigns
  its own reference format. This namespace does NOT invent one; it
  builds a jurisdiction-scoped sequence number and validates the
  record's required fields, the same honest, non-fabricating
  discipline `energy.facts` uses.

  `battery-soc-out-of-range?` is the FIFTH instance of this fleet's
  two-sided range check family (`testlab.registry/within-tolerance?`
  established the first, `conservation.registry/body-condition-out-
  of-range?` the second, `water.registry/contaminant-level-out-of-
  range?` the third, `aerospace.registry/assembly-tolerance-out-of-
  range?` the fourth), applying the SAME lo/hi bounds-comparison shape
  to a site's own measured battery state-of-charge against the site's
  own recorded safe operating-range bounds.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real grid-control/SCADA system. It builds the RECORD an
  operator would keep, not the act of dispatching the battery or
  finalizing the settlement itself (that is `energy.operation`'s
  `:actuation/dispatch-battery`/`:actuation/finalize-settlement`,
  always human-gated -- see README `Actuation`)."
